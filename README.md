doPost expects an object e as a parameter. The function extracts the contents from the postData property of the e object and parses it as JSON.

If the contents object has a property called "message", it retrieves the chat ID from the from.id property and sends a message with a keyboard of bands using the sendKeyboardBands function.

If the contents object has a property called "callback_query", it retrieves the callback data and chat ID from the respective properties. It then retrieves data from a Google Spreadsheet named 'Sheet2' and searches for a match with the callback data. If a match is found, it sends a message with the matched group name using the sendMessage function.

After that, it checks the callback data again. If it matches 'radiohead', it sends a message with a keyboard of albums using the sendKeyboardAlbomR function and appends the callback data to a Google Spreadsheet named 'Sheet1'. If the callback data matches 'n. cave', it does the same with a different keyboard and appends the callback data to the same Google Spreadsheet.

Overall, this code handles different types of requests and performs actions based on the contents of the requests.
